# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe AI Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to integrate deep learning and reinforcement learning into your Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe AI, transitioning from heuristic-based evaluations to a more adaptive approach.

## Phase 1: Project Structuring

**Objective:** Establish a clear and organized project structure to facilitate development and collaboration.

- **1.1 Directory Setup**
  - Create the following directories:
    - `/src`: Core game logic and AI algorithms.
    - `/data`: Storage for training datasets generated from self-play.
    - `/models`: Neural network architectures and training scripts.
    - `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
    - `/tests`: Unit and integration tests.

## Phase 2: Self-Play Implementation

**Objective:** Develop a mechanism where the AI agent can play against itself to generate training data.

- **2.1 Initialize Random Policy**
  - Implement an AI agent that makes random or semi-random moves to simulate gameplay.

- **2.2 Simulate Self-Play Games**
  - Program the agent to play numerous games against itself, recording game states, actions, and outcomes.

- **2.3 Data Storage**
  - Save the recorded data in the `/data` directory for future training purposes.

## Phase 3: Neural Network Development

**Objective:** Create a neural network to evaluate game states and predict outcomes.

- **3.1 Design Network Architecture**
  - Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) suitable for evaluating Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe boards.

- **3.2 Data Preparation**
  - Format the self-play data into input-output pairs suitable for training the neural network.

- **3.3 Model Training**
  - Train the neural network to predict game outcomes based on the prepared data.

## Phase 4: Integration with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

**Objective:** Enhance the AI's decision-making by combining the neural network with MCTS.

- **4.1 Selection Phase Enhancement**
  - Use the neural network to evaluate nodes during the selection phase of MCTS, improving search efficiency.

- **4.2 Backpropagation Update**
  - Update MCTS nodes with evaluations from the neural network to refine future selections.

## Phase 5: Reinforcement Learning Loop

**Objective:** Establish an iterative process for continuous learning and improvement.

- **5.1 Continuous Self-Play**
  - Generate new data through ongoing self-play sessions.

- **5.2 Model Retraining**
  - Retrain the neural network with newly generated data to improve evaluation accuracy.

- **5.3 Policy Update**
  - Update the AI's playing policy based on the improved neural network.

- **5.4 Iteration**
  - Repeat the cycle of self-play, training, and policy updates to progressively enhance AI performance.

## Phase 6: Testing and Evaluation

**Objective:** Regularly assess the AI's performance to ensure continuous improvement.

- **6.1 Benchmarking**
  - Evaluate the AI against predefined benchmarks or other AI agents to measure performance.

- **6.2 Performance Metrics**
  - Track metrics such as win rates, decision times, and accuracy to monitor progress.

- **6.3 Iterative Refinement**
  - Use evaluation results to identify areas for improvement and refine the AI accordingly.
